Git commands and features :

git (Azure Repo and GitHub):

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on code development.
Azure Repos and GitHub are web-based platforms that host Git repositories and provide collaboration tools.

Branching Strategy in Current Project:

A branching strategy defines how code changes are organized into branches, like feature branches, release branches, and the main branch (often main or master).

Pull Request:

A pull request is a feature in platforms like GitHub and Azure DevOps that enables developers to propose code changes to a project.
It's a request for others to review and merge code into the main branch.

Branch:

A branch is a separate line of development in Git, allowing you to work on a specific feature or fix independently.

Pull (Fetch + Merge):

A pull combines two operations: fetching changes from a remote repository and merging those changes into your local branch.

Merge:

Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another branch, typically from a feature branch into the main branch.

Merge Conflict:

A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches, and manual intervention is required to resolve the conflict.

Commit History:

The commit history shows a chronological list of changes made to a Git repository, including who made the changes and when.

Checkout Branch:

The git checkout command is used to switch between different branches in a Git repository.

Create Branch:

The git branch command is used to create a new branch, allowing you to work on a new feature or fix.

Delete Branch:

The git branch -d or git branch -D command is used to delete a branch. -d is for a safe delete, and -D is for a force delete.

Reset:

The git reset command is used to move the HEAD and current branch pointer to a specific commit or undo the latest commits.

git diff:

The git diff command is used to view the differences between commits, branches, or files.

git stash:

The git stash command is used to temporarily save changes that you're not ready to commit, allowing you to switch to another branch or task.

git tag:

Tags are used to mark specific points in Git history, often to denote releases or important commits.

Git Release:

A release in Git refers to a specific version of a software project, often marked with a tag, and may include associated documentation and assets.

Git Rebase:

Rebase is used to rewrite the commit history. It allows you to move, combine, or change commits to make your branch cleaner before merging.

Add, Commit, Push:

These are fundamental Git commands.
git add stages changes for commit.
git commit records changes to the repository with a message.
git push uploads your local changes to a remote repository.
These Git commands and features are essential for version control, collaboration, and project management when working with source code and repositories.
